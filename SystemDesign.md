In this table, each row corresponds to a class in the object class model, and the columns
represent the attributes and relationships of each class. The "Attributes" column lists the
key properties or characteristics of each class, while the "Relationships" column
specifies the types of relationships between each class and any other classes in the
model.
<b><h3>4.2. Functional Model</h3></b>
Functional Modeling is the final component of object-oriented analysis. The functional
model shows the processes that are performed within an object and how the data
changes. <br>

As it moves between methods. It specifies the meaning of the operations of object
modeling and the actions of dynamic modeling. The functional model corresponds to
the data flow diagram of traditional structured analysis.<br>
The process of functional modeling can be visualized in the following steps:<br>

● Identify all the inputs and outputs<br>
● Construct data flow diagrams showing functional dependencies.<br>
● State the purpose of each function.<br>
● Identify constraints.<br>
● Specify optimization criteria.<br>
